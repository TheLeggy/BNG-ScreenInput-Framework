Development Preview License

Copyright (c) 2025 TheLeggy

This software is provided as a DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW and is made available
under the following terms:

WHY THESE RESTRICTIONS:
To ensure stability and prevent conflicts, this framework maintains a single
canonical version. Allowing redistribution could lead to version fragmentation
where multiple incompatible copies exist in the ecosystem, causing conflicts
and compatibility issues (similar to "DLL hell"). By maintaining one official
distribution channel, all users benefit from the same stable, tested version.
